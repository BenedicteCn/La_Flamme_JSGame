# LA FLAMME | Projet 1: Game - Bénédicte Coulon

## Introduction

La Flamme Game is based on the french TV show "La Flamme".

## Requirements

- [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repo
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you use `class` and `id` selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify _every_ element of that type
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The background with a picture of the apple pie
  - The recipe servings / nutrients section
  - The prep section

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

You will be working in the `apple-pie` folder. There you will find all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a CSS file is created in `styles/style.css`.

## Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected results below:

## Extra Practice

If you feel you need more practice, you can keep working on the `french-soup` exercise. There you will find `expected-result.md` file where you can see what is expected from you to build. This folder has the same structure as the the `apple-pie` one so follow the same steps.
